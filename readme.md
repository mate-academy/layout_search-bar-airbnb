### Tips & Hints
- Add **ALL** `data-qa` attributes required in the task
- Text `Try "Los Angeles"` is a placeholder.
- Use `&quot;` instead of `"` in the placeholder.
- Pay close attention to font styles. Use fonts from `fonts` folder.
- You have to put `input` inside the `form` for correct data processing. Form should have `action` and `method`
attributes.
- Each search bar be inside its own `form` element.
- Task has styling for `:focus` state. Forms, labels, divs are not focusable by default. Consider it when selecting your
layout.
- Remember that inputs and other interactive elements don’t inherit font styles by default.
- Remember that placeholder has its own set of styles available using `::placeholder` pseudo-element.
