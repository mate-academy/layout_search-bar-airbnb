## Bugs

This is where I posted the site and the report,<br>
https://m-bayrak.github.io/layout_search-bar-airbnb/src/<br>
https://m-bayrak.github.io/layout_search-bar-airbnb/backstop_data/engine_scripts/report/html_report/index.html <br>
because there were errors that I described below ↓↓↓

On the computer **localhost:8080**, the search page is displayed normally and the test passes. When creating a Pull Request on the **GitHub** platform, a conflict occurs during verification (passing the test) based on the **package.json** file https://prnt.sc/4aJyvflXJzTj  

When I fix these errors then the test on **GitHub** runs without conflicts, but the report is not displayed and the site is displayed 
without CSS settings https://prnt.sc/Mo2RvqbCTuH7 

So I deployed the site to **GitHub** in the **develop** branch and manually uploaded the report.
In different projects, from time to time the **Mate script** gives similar failures

This code must be present in order for the test to be properly checked on a **Mac**<br>
    "@mate-academy/stylelint-config": "*",<br>
    "@parcel/transformer-sass": "^2.10.2",
