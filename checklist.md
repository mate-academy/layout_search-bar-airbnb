- check your work using basic recommendations -> [here](https://github.com/mate-academy/layout_colored-blocks/blob/master/checklist.md)
- about design: if you see a cursor in the input, that means styles are for entered text by the user (not only on focus action)
- if you have 3 or more attributes, place each one on the new line (including the first one)
- font family is usually written for `body` tag and inherited by others
- we preferably use classes for styling, not tags, ids, attributes or something else
- don't increase specificity of selectors ([about selectors specificity](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp))
